# Mastering IPython 4.0

This is the code repository for [Mastering IPython 4.0](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-ipython-40?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785888410), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## Instructions
Chapter-wise software requirements (with version):

* Chapter 2: Python 3.4.2, IPython 4.0.1
* Chapter 3: Python libraries (ipyparallel, numpy, scipy)
* Chapter 4: ZeroMQ 4.1.4, MPI 4.0, Python libraries (mpi4py, zmq)
* Chapter 6: R, Octave, Hy, Python libraries (rpy2, oct2py, hymagic)
* Chapter 7: R packages (ggplot2), Python libraries (matplotlib, bokeh, pandas, python-nvd3)
* Chapter 8: Python libraries (pytest, nose2)
* Chapter 9: Python libraries (docutils, sphinx)
* Chapter 10: Jupyter

The list is probably best understood as being cumulative, with each chapter requiring all the software from the previous chapters, plus (possibly) more.
